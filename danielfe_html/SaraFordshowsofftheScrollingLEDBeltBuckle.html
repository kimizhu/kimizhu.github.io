<div id='content'><p>Last week, Clint published the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/events/holidays/article.aspx?articleid=1228621&amp;title=Holiday+Gift+Guide+2006">Coding4Fun Holiday Gift Guide 2006</a> and I spammed some internal Microsoft aliases that I thought would be interested in the list of presents. Long story short, it turns out that our own <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford">Sara Ford</a>&nbsp;happens to be the proud owner of one of our picks for the top 10 presents for developers, the Scrolling LED Belt Buckle. </p> <p>Of course, I had to ask Sara to bring it in and show it off, so here's Sara striking a Karate pose wearing the Scrolling LED Belt Buckle. </p> <p><img height="267" src="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SaraFordshowsofftheScrollingLEDBeltBuckl_746F/sara%5B4%5D.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SaraFordshowsofftheScrollingLEDBeltBuckl_746F/sara%5B4%5D.jpg" width="400"> </p> <p>In case you don't know, Sara is a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2006/10/23/karate-tournament-results.aspx">tournament winning</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2006/01/18/514720.aspx">black-belt</a>, and works on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/">Josh's team</a> on things like the VS Power Toys and other DevDiv open source projects. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Here's a close-up of the Scrolling LED Belt Buckle with a "Love VS" message</p> <p><img height="103" src="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SaraFordshowsofftheScrollingLEDBeltBuckl_746F/buckle1%5B4%5D.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SaraFordshowsofftheScrollingLEDBeltBuckl_746F/buckle1%5B4%5D.jpg" width="300"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>"The Photo Shoot"</strong></p> <p>For these shots,&nbsp;I brought in my Canon EOS 20D Digital SLR and shot the Karate shots at&nbsp;high-speed and the close-up shots at low speed using a tripod to steady the camera. Interestingly enough,&nbsp;photographing this was tougher than expected because:</p> <ul> <li>We were photographing in the middle of a hallway in building 41</li> <li>The message is scrolling which means you need to time it correctly</li> <li>I'm asking Sara to hold still during a strenuous Karate pose</li> <li>LED displays are actually an optical illusion, more below</li></ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>LEDs are an optical illusion <br></strong>At any point in time, any portion of the LEDs in the scrolling message will be actually&nbsp;turning themselves on and off&nbsp;many times a second. While the human eye doesn't see these small variations,&nbsp;a digital camera capturing at a high speed does. Here's a close-up of the LED display&nbsp;photographed at&nbsp;high speed which shows&nbsp;that our eyes are too slow to notice the missing "V" from VS. </p> <p><img height="191" src="https://msdnshared.blob.core.windows.net/media/TNBlogsFS/BlogFileStorage/blogs_msdn/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SaraFordshowsofftheScrollingLEDBeltBuckl_746F/blink%5B4%5D.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/danielfe/WindowsLiveWriter/SaraFordshowsofftheScrollingLEDBeltBuckl_746F/blink%5B4%5D.jpg" width="161"> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Big thanks to Sara for being a good sport and showing off her LED Belt Buckle!</p></div>
