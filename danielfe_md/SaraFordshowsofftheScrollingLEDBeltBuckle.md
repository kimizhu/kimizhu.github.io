Last week, Clint published the [Coding4Fun Holiday Gift
Guide 2006](http://msdn.microsoft.com/coding4fun/events/holidays/article.aspx?articleid=1228621&title=Holiday+Gift+Guide+2006)
and I spammed some internal Microsoft aliases that I thought would be
interested in the list of presents. Long story short, it turns out that
our own [Sara Ford](http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford) happens to be the
proud owner of one of our picks for the top 10 presents for developers,
the Scrolling LED Belt Buckle.

Of course, I had to ask Sara to bring it in and show it off, so here's
Sara striking a Karate pose wearing the Scrolling LED Belt
Buckle.

In case you don't know, Sara is a [tournament

[black-belt](http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/archive/2006/01/18/514720.aspx),
and works on [Josh's team](http://blogs.msdn.com/jledgard/) on things
like the VS Power Toys and other DevDiv open source projects.  

 

Here's a close-up of the Scrolling LED Belt Buckle with a "Love VS"
message

**"The Photo Shoot"**

For these shots, I brought in my Canon EOS 20D Digital SLR and shot the
Karate shots at high-speed and the close-up shots at low speed using a
tripod to steady the camera. Interestingly enough, photographing this
was tougher than expected because:

  - We were photographing in the middle of a hallway in building 41
  - The message is scrolling which means you need to time it correctly
  - I'm asking Sara to hold still during a strenuous Karate pose
  - LED displays are actually an optical illusion, more below

 

**LEDs are an optical illusion  
**At any point in time, any portion of the LEDs in the scrolling message
will be actually turning themselves on and off many times a second.
While the human eye doesn't see these small variations, a digital camera
capturing at a high speed does. Here's a close-up of the LED
display photographed at high speed which shows that our eyes are too
slow to notice the missing "V" from
VS.

Big thanks to Sara for being a good sport and showing off her LED Belt
Buckle\!
