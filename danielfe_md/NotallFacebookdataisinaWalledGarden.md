# Not all Facebook data is in a "Walled Garden"

The *Facebook is a "Walled Garden"* meme continues today with a post
from pal [Robert
Scoble](http://scobleizer.com/2007/08/02/the-latest-shiny-social-object-an-opencontrollable-social-network/) that
continues the assumption that all Facebook data is somehow "locked" into
Facebook. Here's a quick snippet:

While Scoble is correct that Facebook's video application is locked
inside their "Walled Garden", Facebook has provided, in [my
opinion](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/articles/106589.aspx), **the
most open social networking platform in existence** and arguably the
most open Web site today.

 

Way back in
[August 2006](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?blog_id=company&blogger=8055),
Facebook announced the Facebook Development Platform, which they
describe as

>  "...*a standards-based web service with methods for accessing and
> contributing Facebook data.*"

Facebook effectively **added a door to their walled garden** in August
2006 that any Facebook user or developer could use to pull data directly
from their servers. They documented everything and even added a very
nice [query language](http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=2245872130)
(Facebook Query Language) to simplify and optimize accessing their data.

 

Assuming you opt-in to allow your data to be pulled (a one-time
operation), you can pull a [huge amount of Facebook
data](http://developers.facebook.com/documentation.php?v=1.0&doc=fql)
ranging from your network's friends, favorite books, current status
(FacebookVision anyone?), events, photos, groups, and much
more.

Scoble calls Facebook the new Rolodex. Well guess what, there already is
a Facebook Rolodex-like application that's pulls data from that Walled
Garden's door directly onto a desktop application. It's all part of the
open source [Facebook Developer
Toolkit](http://blogs.msdn.com/coding4fun/archive/2007/05/24/2854939.aspx)
which makes it dirt-simple for .NET developers to pull Facebook data
outside of the so-called Walled
Garden.

**What about non-developers?**

How would Scoble get data out of Facebook though since he's not a
developer? Well, for one, any company or even a Facebook competitor
could do this, but beyond that, you can use
[Popfly](http://www.popfly.com) to, without a single line of code, pull
your list of friends from Facebook. This isn't new, in fact Dan'l Lewin,
Microsoft corporate Vice President discussed this exact scenario on
stage with Mark Zuckerberg at the [Facebook platform
launch](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2007/05/24/facebook-f8-event-photos.aspx).

Still don't believe non-developers can do this? Then I suggest
you [watch my recently published shaky-cam
video](http://blogs.msdn.com/somasegar/archive/2007/07/27/playing-around-w-popfly-and-facebook.aspx)
with Soma, the Vice President of Developer Division and his 14-year old
daughter, Sahanna, showing how she can build applications using Facebook
data with <span class="underline">zero</span> code.

 

And yes, I've sent an email to the Facebook development team asking them
to expose the videos from their **Video application** through their
API's too :)

 

Perhaps this will help better shine the light on all the cool stuff
Microsoft's been doing with Facebook :)
