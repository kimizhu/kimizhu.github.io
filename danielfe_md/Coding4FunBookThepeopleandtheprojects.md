Our [Coding4Fun
book](http://www.amazon.com/Coding4Fun-Programming-Projects-Wiimote-Warcraft/dp/0596520743/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1228933817&sr=8-1),
*Coding4Fun 10 .NET Programming Projects for Wiimote, World of Warcraft,
YouTube, and More* officially released to the world last week. Unlike
your typical .NET development book, Coding4Fun is about learning how to
use your developer skills to do fun, cool projects (see below for the
full list). All of the .NET projects are in VB and C\#, with the
exception of the XNA chapter as XNA only supports C\# at this time.

I wanted to send a big thank you to everyone who helped write, edit, and
review our book's content, especially Laurel Ruma from O'Reilly
publishing for all of her work and for being a great advocate for our
book\!
